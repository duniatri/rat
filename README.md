rat is short of "resource allocation tools".
I want to create a tools to show how busy i am. hahaha

for the beginning, i just created a script to calculate how many working hours per week and per month.
to do that, i need to:
- define what is my 100% working hours (without overtime)
- define the duration for each activity. in the script i wrote as a, b, c, d,... until l
- list the project name
- define activity need to be done per week
- calculate per week working hours
- calculate per month working hours, and the percentage

next step that i want to do are:
- make a dashboard to easily show my working hours by using shyny
- make a web app by using shiny to input the data and automate the dashboard making

some questions that i need to know the answer:
- beside showing the total working hours per week, how can i know what activity per week that i need to do?
- is it possible this tools also can be used by other people via web app? i'm thingking other user need to log in to create their own calculation.

i hope i can finish it soon, so that my boss know how busy i am. hahaha
if you guys have answers of my question above, do let me know!
